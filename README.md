Successfully Deployed code and hosted a Static web Application with AWS (Amazon Web Services)

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I used AWS services to automate the deployment and scaling of a fully functional Static website!

AWS Services Used:

AWS Code Pipeline: Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline for seamless code updates.

AWS Code Deploy: Automated deployment to Amazon EC2 instances, ensuring quick rollouts.

Amazon EC2: Provided  flexible, scalable computing resources to host the application.

Amazon S3: Stored static assets like product images and website scripts.

AWS IAM: Enables secure access management by defining user permissions and roles for AWS resources.

Amazon VPC: Allows users to create isolated networks within the AWS cloud, enabling control over networking resources and security.

AWS CloudFormation: Automates resource provisioning and management using templates to define and deploy infrastructure as code.

Amazon SQS: Fully managed message queuing service for decoupling and scaling applications.

Amazon SNS: Scalable messaging and notification service for multiple recipients via various protocols.

AWS CloudTrail: Logs AWS account activity and API calls for security and compliance.

Amazon CloudWatch: Real-time monitoring of AWS resources with metrics and logs for performance optimization.

App Load Balancer: Routes traffic across multiple targets, optimizing resource use and availability.

Auto Scaling Group: Adjusts EC2 instance counts based on traffic demand for performance and cost efficiency.

Amazon CloudFront: A CDN that caches content globally, reducing latency and improving load times.

What I Achieved and the Impact:

Deployed code and hosted static websites using a load balancer to distribute traffic across different servers based on URL paths and implemented autoscaling automatically scale vertically when CPU utilization exceeded 80%, achieving a 90% improvement in application performance.
Resolved high-latency issues by integrating CloudFront,
reduced application processing time by 50% through cache and
efficiently delivering content to users.
